<p></p><center><b><h1>Using a Stack to Evaluate an Expression</h1></b></center>
<p>We often deal with arithmetic expressions written in what is
 called <u>infix notation</u>:
<pre>         Operand1 op Operand2</pre>
<p>We have rules to indicate which operations take precedence over
 others, and we often use parentheses to override those rules.
<p>It is also quite possible to write arithmetic expressions using
 <u>postfix notation</u>:
<pre>         Operand1 Operand2 op</pre>
<p>With postfix notation, it is possible to use a stack to find 
 the overall value of an infix expression by first converting it to 
 postfix notation.
<p>Example: Suppose we have this infix expression Q:
<pre>         5 * ( 6 + 2 ) - 12 / 4</pre>
<p>The equivalent postfix expression P is:
<pre>         5 6 2 + * 12 4 / -</pre>
<p>This discussion assumes all our operations are <i>binary</i> operations
 (2 arguments each). Notice that we also sometimes use <i>unary</i> 
 operations such as ++ or -- or the unary + and -.
<p>We are not including the possibility of array elements in this 
 discussion. (The subscript can be an expression which would have to 
 be evaluated.)
<p>One way to think of an expression is as a list or sequence of
 items, each of which is a left parenthesis, right parenthesis,
 argument, or operator. An argument can be a constant or the name
 of a variable. Presumably it would be necessary at some point to 
 replace each variable with its value.
<p>There are two algorithms involved. One converts an infix 
 expression to postfix form, and the other evaluates a postfix 
 expression. Each uses a stack.
<p><hr>
<p><b>Transform an infix expression to postfix notation</b>
<p>Suppose Q is an arithmetic expression in infix notation. We 
 will create an equivalent postfix expression P by adding items to on 
 the right of P. The new expression P will not contain any parentheses. 
<p>We will use a stack in which each item may be a left parenthesis 
 or the symbol for an operation. 
<pre>     Start with an empty stack.  We scan Q from left to right. 

     While (we have not reached the end of Q)
        If (an operand is found)
           Add it to P
        End-If
        If (a left parenthesis is found) 
           Push it onto the stack
        End-If
        If (a right parenthesis is found) 
           While (the stack is not empty AND the top item is
                  not a left parenthesis)
              Pop the stack and add the popped value to P
           End-While
           Pop the left parenthesis from the stack and discard it 
        End-If
        If (an operator is found)
           If (the stack is empty or if the top element is a left
               parenthesis)
              Push the operator onto the stack
           Else  
              While (the stack is not empty AND the top of the stack 
                     is not a left parenthesis AND precedence of the                  
                     operator &lt;= precedence of the top of the stack)
                 Pop the stack and add the top value to P
              End-While
              Push the latest operator onto the stack     
           End-If  
        End-If
     End-While
     While (the stack is not empty)
        Pop the stack and add the popped value to P
     End-While</pre>
<p>Notes:
<ul>
 <li>At the end, if there is still a left parenthesis at the 
 top of the stack, or if we find a right parenthesis when the stack is 
 empty, then Q contained unbalanced parentheses and is in error.
</ul>
<p><hr>
<p><b>Evaluate a postfix expression</b>
<p>Suppose P is an arithmetic expression in postfix notation.
 We will evaluate it using a stack to hold the operands. 
<pre>     Start with an empty stack.  We scan P from left to right.

     While (we have not reached the end of P)
        If an operand is found
           push it onto the stack
        End-If
        If an operator is found
           Pop the stack and call the value A
           Pop the stack and call the value B
           Evaluate B op A using the operator just found.
           Push the resulting value onto the stack
        End-If
    End-While
    Pop the stack (this is the final value)</pre>
<p>Notes:
<ul>
 <li>At the end, there should be only one element left on the stack.
 <p>
 </p><li>This assumes the postfix expression is valid.
</ul>
<p><hr>
<p><b>How can this be implemented?</b>
<p>Work like this is usually done by an assembler, compiler or 
 interpreter. A programmer uses an expression in her or her code, and
 evaluating it is someone else's problem. 
<p>Suppose it is our problem (maybe we are writing an interpreter).
 The interpreter is reading a line at a time from a file as a
 string, such as
<pre>         A = ((B + C) / 3 - 47 % E) * (F + 8)</pre>
<p>The string needs to be parsed--that is, we need to break it up 
 into substrings, each of which is one meaningful part. These 
 substrings are often called <u>tokens</u>. The tokens are separated by 
 spaces, in many cases, but also a token ends if we find a left or 
 right parenthesis or the symbol for an operator. Thus for instance,
 in the above example, we have "E)", and this consists of two tokens
 "E" and ")". Bear in mind that the symbol for an operator can be more
 than one character.
<p>We then have a list of tokens, perhaps in an array or a linked 
 list. Somewhere we will have an Evaluate function which takes such a 
 list as an argument and returns a numeric value.
